title: macOS Login Shells
description: |-
  In other unix systems terminal emulators are generally started
  using non-login shells. Due to various reasons, macOS defaults 
  all shells as login shells.
---

By default, macOS shells are started as login shells. Traditionally unix systems
start terminal emulators as non-login interactive shells, only calling the shells
rc files per instance, and running .profile files as the user logs in.

Ghostty respects the macOS defaults when run on macOS, and will start each shell
as a login shell.

## Why Login Shells

Traditionally, unix shells have two main files that expect to be run before the user
is able to interact with the shell; a profile file and the rc file. Since macOS 
10.15 (macOS Catalina) the default shell is zsh which uses the `.zprofile` and 
`.zshrc` files. On most Linux systems `.zprofile` (or similar) is executed when the user
initially logs in. This is due to whatever GUI is being used to login was 
itself started by a login shell, letting subsequent shells inherit the environment
and any setup done by `.zprofile`. The idea here is that any expensive 
initialization only needs done once at login, and subsequent shells can reuse
everything from the setup process.

<Note>
We use zsh as the example shell, however most shells can be interchanged and
have the same behavior, with the exception of bash. Bash will **only** read
`.bashrc` if the shell is both interactive and non-login. Since macOS moved from
tcsh to bash in OSX 10.2 Jaguar, this difference in bash may have been
overlooked, resulting in developers placing their shell setup entirely in 
`.profile` as `.bashrc` would rarely be run, specifically not by starting a new 
terminal. Now that zsh is the new default, `.zprofile` and `.zshrc` are both 
called starting an interavtive non-login shell.
</Note>

macOS differs in that the GUI used to login to the system does not run `.zprofile`
as it has its own method of loading in system level global settings. This means
that any terminal emulator must run shells as login or else new shells would
be potentially broken since they would be missing any setup process in 
`.zprofile`. This is the unfortunate reality, but makes sense in that there is no
`.xsession` or similar, since `.zprofile` is never run, that can give a users
terminals access to initial settings or set things like global environment 
variables [^1].

This however does *not* mean that everything should just go in `.zprofile`, or 
that the two files are always called together. Since zsh in started in login
mode and interactive mode, both `.zprofile` and `.zshrc` will run every time
a new terminal is created, however, if you run a shell inside of a terminal 
emulator that will only be an interactive shell, it will lose access to the 
parent shells settings that were initialized in `.zprofile`. You can test this
by placing an alias in your `.zprofile` and starting a terminal instance and
running that alias, then run `zsh` and you will find that the alias is no longer
available.

Therefore, most shell setup should still go in the `.zshrc` file so that any shells, 
terminal or otherwise, are initialized correctly. This is also somewhat in line
with how dotfiles on other Linux systems would be written.
